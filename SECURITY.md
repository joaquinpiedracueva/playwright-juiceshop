## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by opening an issue on the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/joaquinpiedracueva/playwright-juiceshop/issues) page. Use the `playwright` label for vulnerabilities related to the Playwright framework, since the page is also used for `juice-shop` issues found during automated testing.

Since this is a test automation framework and does not handle user data or run in production, most security concerns are low risk. However, all reports are appreciated and will be reviewed.
